# Vibrowtion
'Vibrowtion' is a small project for the Engineering Design course at the [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl). The project group consists of 5 students: Thimo Derks, Sophie van Leeuwen, Tim Middelhoek, Stan van Tussenbroek, and Tom Udding.

### About
Vibrowtion is a system that allows a disabled (blind and/or deaf) rower to maintain the same rhythm as other rowers. This is possible by determining the state of the rowing stroke (using [Actio Potentialis](https://github.com/tomudding/Actio-Potentialis)) and signalling the disabled rower (through vibrational feedback).
